# Losses

No loss has been implemented yet. If you believe you have a good implementation of a particular loss function, feel free to open a PR!

If you are searching for a loss that is able to easily encode hard constraints in propositional logic, be free to check our repo about constrained training: [Semantic Loss PyTorch](https://github.com/lucadiliello/semantic-loss-pytorch)
